Exercises
    1. What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?
        Compiler is compile source code to one executable file.
        Interpreter is read one line code, execute, read next, 直到 file end.
    2-a. What are the advantages of a compiler over an interpreter?
        Executable file execute faster than interpreter.
    2-b. What are the advantages of an interpreter over a compiler?
        No compile, so faster to run.
        更詳細的 debug information, 方便 debug.
    3. What advantages are there to a language-processing system in which the compiler produces assembly language rather than machine language?
        asm is easy read 比起 machine code, and asm is easier to 移植.
    4. A compiler that translates a hgh-level language into another high-level language is called a source-to-source translator. What advantages are there to using C as a target language for a compiler?
        Compile to C can 借用 other compiler 的優化, can easy use C lib.
    5. Describe some of the tasks that an assembler needs to perform.
        Assembler needs translate assembly code to machine code.

直到 until 
更詳細的 detailed 
方便 easily (從形容詞變成副詞，因為搭配動詞debug 要加動詞)
比起 compare 
移植 migrate 
借用 borrow 
優化 optimization

可以補充：編譯器產生的通常是機器碼或目標碼，不一定是單一「可執行檔」，也可能是中間碼(如 Java 的 bytecode)
2 建議改為：「不需預先編譯，修改後可立即執行，適合開發和測試。錯誤回饋即時，方便除錯。」
not need pre-compile, can run after modify, 適合 develop and test. error feedback 及時, easily debug.

適合 suitable
及時 timely
